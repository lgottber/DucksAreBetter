# ducksAreBetter
# A fun app I created when learning go
# User inputs their favorite animal and is informed that they are wrong because ducks are the best animal
# From here the app downloads images of ducks from a URL and picks a duck picture to open based on the amount of characters in the user's favorite animal and force opens the selected picture in a web browser :)
